ShoppingList
============
hey, this is my unfinished project of webpage for shopping list.
it was supposed to work by running the server-script ("node server-script.js" in shell), and then opening "shopping.html".
because it is unfinished, when running it the client side doesn't get the data sent by the server, 
so one can run it by opening "shopping.js", uncommettimg the first decleration of the var "itemsList" (lines 32-49)
and put the second decleration in comment (line 120), and the opening "shopping.html" (no need to run the server script, naturally).
